                    Do you remember the first kiss?
                    Star shooting across the sky
                    To come to such a place as this
                    You never left my mind
                    
                    I'm watching from the wall
                    As in the streets we fight
                    This world all gone to war
                    All I need is you tonight
                    
                    And I draw a line
                    To your heart today
                    To your heart from mine
                    A line to keep us safe
                    
                    All through the rising sun
                    All through the circling years
                    You were the only one
                    Who could have brought me here
                    And I draw a line
                    To your heart today
                    To your heart from mine
                    One line to keep us safe
                    
                    And I draw a line
                    To your heart today
                    To your heart from mine
                    And pray to keep us safe
                    Watch the stars now moving
                    Across the sky
                    Keep this feeling
                    Safe tonight
                </pre>
